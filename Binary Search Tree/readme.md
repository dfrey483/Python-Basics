3. Write a Python program to check whether a given a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST) or not. Go to the editor

Let a binary search tree (BST) is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Example 1:
    2
   / \
  1   3
Binary tree [2,1,3], return true.
Example 2:
    1
   / \
  2   3
Binary tree [1,2,3], return false.

4. Write a Python program to delete a node with the given key in a given Binary search tree (BST). Go to the editor
Note: Search for a node to remove. If the node is found, delete the node.
